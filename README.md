# ThreadBot

A basic app that replies to people who should be posting in thread. 

1- Install to Workspace
2- Create a custom emoji called :threadbot:
3- Add to any channels where you want threadbot to reply to messages
4- Bot listens for the REMOVAL of the :threadbot: emoji, and replies to the message with a gentle reminder to reply in thread
